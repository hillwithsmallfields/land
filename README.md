# land
Scripts for landing on a new host.

Originally aimed at setting up a Raspberry Pi after I have overwritten its SD card with a new Raspbian; but I may make it more general.

Configurable using JSON, so the command lines don't get out of hand.

Also includes an Arduino sketch for autotyping the commands to do the setup (for Arduino Micro and the keyboard library).
